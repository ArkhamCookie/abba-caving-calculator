## What's Abba Caving?

ABBA Caving is a minigame created by [VintageBeef](https://www.youtube.com/@VintageBeef) and [AnderZEL](https://www.youtube.com/@ImAnderZEL) on the Minecrack Minecraft SMP.
The game gets its name from the song "Winner Takes All" by ABBA, because the terms of the game state that the winner's prize is all the ores mined during the tournament's run. [^1]
